Step-by-Step
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# 1️⃣ Separate features and target
# Assume 'price' is the target column (adjust if your dataset uses a different name)
X = df_scaled.drop('price', axis=1)
y = df_scaled['price']

# 2️⃣ Split into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y,
    test_size=0.2,       # 80% training, 20% testing
    random_state=42      # for reproducibility
)

# 3️⃣ Print shapes to verify
print("X_train shape:", X_train.shape)
print("X_test shape:", X_test.shape)
print("y_train shape:", y_train.shape)
print("y_test shape:", y_test.shape)
