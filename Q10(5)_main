**1. Survived**
- The target variable shows class imbalance: more passengers died than survived.
- Visuals like bar plots and pairplots show that survival is highly dependent on **gender** and **class**.

**2. Pclass (Passenger Class)**
- Majority of passengers were from **3rd class**, and they had the lowest survival rate.
- Higher survival observed in **1st class**, visible in both bar plots and survival overlays.

**3. Sex**
- **Females had a much higher survival rate** than males.
- Visuals clearly highlight gender-based priority during rescue operations.

**4. Age**
- Distribution is skewed toward younger passengers (20–40 years most common).
- **Boxplots show outliers**, and missing values are present in this column.
- Children under 10 had better survival odds compared to other age groups.

**5. Fare**
- **Highly skewed**, with a few passengers paying extremely high fares (clear outliers).
- Boxplot shows long upper tail and outliers.
- Higher fares are associated with 1st class and greater chance of survival.

**6. SibSp (Siblings/Spouses Aboard)**
- Most passengers had 0 or 1 sibling/spouse.
- Larger family sizes (≥4) are rare and may reduce survival chances.
- Boxplots show some anomalies, such as passengers with up to 8 siblings/spouses.

**7. Parch (Parents/Children Aboard)**
- Similar to SibSp, most passengers had 0 parents/children.
- Those traveling with small families (1–2) had slightly better survival rates than those alone.

**8. Embarked**
- Most passengers embarked from **Southampton (S)**.
- Passengers from **Cherbourg (C)** had higher survival rates, possibly due to class distribution.

**9. Correlation Matrix Insights**
- `Fare` and `Pclass` are strongly negatively correlated.
- `Survived` has a weak positive correlation with `Fare` and negative with `Pclass`.
- `SibSp` and `Parch` show a small positive correlation (traveling with family).

**Conclusion:**
Visual analysis reveals strong survival links with **Sex**, **Pclass**, and **Fare**. Outliers and skewed distributions need preprocessing. These feature-level insights guide us in selecting, transforming, and engineering features for better model accuracy.
