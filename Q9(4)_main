**1. Survival Trends by Gender and Class**
- Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males.
- Passengers from 1st class had the highest survival rate, followed by 2nd class, then 3rd class.
- This suggests **gender and socio-economic status** strongly influenced survival.

**2. Fare Patterns and Outliers**
- Most fares were concentrated under 50 units.
- A few passengers paid extremely high fares (e.g., over 500) — clear **outliers**.
- These high fares are typically associated with 1st class passengers.

**3. Age Distribution Insights**
- The majority of passengers were aged between 20 and 40 years.
- Some children and elderly survived — possibly due to rescue prioritization.
- **Missing values in Age** need to be handled (e.g., using median imputation).

**4. Correlation Observations**
- `Fare` is **negatively correlated** with `Pclass` (i.e., higher class → higher fare).
- `SibSp` and `Parch` show positive correlation — indicating passengers often traveled with family.
- `Survived` is:
  - **Positively correlated** with `Fare` (wealthier → more likely to survive).
  - **Negatively correlated** with `Pclass` (lower class → less likely to survive).

**5. Outliers Detected via Boxplots**
- `Fare` and `Age` contain visible outliers.
- `SibSp` shows rare cases with up to 8 siblings/spouses onboard — unusual travel groups.

**6. General Trends**
- Passengers with family onboard had better chances of survival.
- Solo travelers in 3rd class had the lowest survival rate.
- The dataset has **skewness** and **missing values** that must be addressed before modeling.

**Conclusion:**
The dataset shows clear social and economic biases in survival. Variables like **Sex**, **Pclass**, and **Fare** are key predictors. Anomalies like high fares and large families may influence model outcomes if not treated properly.
